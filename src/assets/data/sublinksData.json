					"content": "We laser cut in most type of materials.There are many advantages to choosing laser cutting. Firstly, our laser cutters have high precision and provide fine and precise cuts in your material. With laser cutting, you can get both complicated patterns and straight lines. Because the laser beam is so thin, very little material is spilled. Materials that have been cut with a laser also do not need to be post-processed, which means that production is faster than with other methods.We provide laser cutting, bending, welding, riveting, coating  and assembling of sheet metal.Today we produce everything from shims for industrial fixtures to component plates for electrical cabinets.",
